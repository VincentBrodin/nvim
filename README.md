# Minimal Neovim Config

My previous Neovim configuration became bloated, with multiple files and nested directories. It felt like I was drifting away from the simplicity that made me switch to nvim in the first place.

This new configuration is my attempt to keep things **minimal yet powerful** just what I need, without unnecessary complexity.

## Goals
- **Simplicity:** A single, clean, and easy-to-understand config.  
- **Minimalism:** Use as few plugins as possible.  
- **Full functionality:** No compromises on features I actually need.

## Plugins Used
- [eyeliner.nvim](https://github.com/jinh0/eyeliner.nvim) – Highlight and jump to characters easily.  
- [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim) – A simple, modern file explorer.  
- [autoclose.nvim](https://github.com/m4xshen/autoclose.nvim) – Auto-closing pairs for a smoother editing experience.  
- [mini.pick](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.pick) – Lightweight picker functionality.  
- [mini.completion](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.completion) – Minimal autocompletion.  
- [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) – Easy setup for LSP servers.  
- [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) – Manage LSP servers, DAPs, linters, and formatters.
